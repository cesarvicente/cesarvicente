## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a C# backend developer, primarily working on Console and Windows Forms applications. Most of my experience is in building APIs and Services, ensuring clean architecture and performance.

While backend is my main focus, I also have full-stack skills and have worked on some MAUI projects for personal needs. I'm always learning and improving, exploring new technologies to expand my expertise.

Feel free to check out my repositories! ðŸš€
